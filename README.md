# RENTAL_SYSTEM

Code for a menu-driven rental system for a hotel....(its mostly just to practise stuff I've learnt and sharpen skills)
so don't expect too much and I'm still working on  the business logic and stuff(which is a major part)
Im just trying to make sure the whole renting system works first(adding tenants, displaying them, removing...that kinda thing)
BUT I think there's a design flaw tho...I'm not really sure...maybe shoulda use structs rather to save details of tenants..idrk...

*Passwords are in Gen_Utilities.h, under login() function. line:19*


### TO-DO TASKS: (In Order Of Priority)
- Implement "Option 2: Check for Available rooms"
- Option to remove tenant
- Option to seek for a particular tenant
- Add Business Logic
- Prevent same tenant from registering multiple times
  (or not cuz i was thinking if a person had the money he/she is entitled to as many rooms as he/she can afford)
- Add validation of phone number in registration
- Allow user to edit changes of details before registration is complete
- Redo the whole roomPrices logic smh...what is there is just a mess :facepalm:

### **COMPLETED TO-DO TASKS:**
- ~~Prevent adding tenants after limit of 10 is reached~~

***CONFIRMED:***
- I'm redoing this project using structs and design similar to my mini-database project from earlier
  but I'll keep this project for future reference
